# photo-site
## Personal photography site
This was the first iteration of my personal photography website. I built this almost entirely from scratch, only utilizing a little bit of JavaScript for the nav bar. It is responsive across all sizes of mobile devices and monitors.

## Issues
I did all of my testing of this site in Google Chrome with devtools. There are aspects of the layout and functionality that do not work in iOS and Safari. These issues triggered me to rebuild the site using bootstrap.
